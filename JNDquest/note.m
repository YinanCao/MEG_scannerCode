% in our previous behav experiment:
% when bkg = 0.5, which is neutral grey

% c, c = 1: white
% c = 0, see nothing, it's basiclaly just the bkg 

% now, due to FT, bkg = 0.325
% now, c=1, we still see a white (this white is brighter than the white on neutral grey)
% c=0, physically, c=0.5; 

% let's imagine jnd = 0.1 in behavioral lab, (static, no FT), peter,
% another sugjec

% now, whaat if in our MEG FT version, we got a jnd = 0.1; mary, subject
